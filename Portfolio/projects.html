      <tr><td><b>Projects made by Benjamin Rampersaud</b><br> 
        These are some of my projects<br><br>
        This project was for my school project, the idea behind the project was to create a trivia game.<be>
          The project was done on replit <b></b>https://replit.com/@BenjaminRampers/PythonProjectTriviaGame</b><br>
          I used the Pil library to make a png, which I have displayed as well as using the console for the bulk of the game.<br>
          The display png aptly named display.png, is changed based on what you're doing in the game and how well you're doing.<br>
          The main game code(the code that gives you the questions and you interact with) is put inside a while loop.<br> 
          Inside the loop, I used multiple functions which made it easier for organizing and to have less repeats of the code.<br>
          The questions were made using objects, and put inside an array, Some of the categories have no questions.<br>
          I also wanted to let the player make custom questions, it was done by having a loop for the amount of questions to be input and putting the object immediately in the array.<br>
          I was going to add files that would be saved but in the interest of simplicity they have none<br><br>

          <div align="left">
          I also worked on an html, and java script project with my brother.<br>
          The project is a chess game but the pieces have hit points, and the roll dice for damage.<br><br>
          
          Another project I made was a Python project for my English class.<br>
           It is a game that is inspired by the organ trail.<br>
          In it, you play as Odysseus and will undergo the Odyssey.</div>
